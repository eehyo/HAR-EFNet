# HAR-EFNet: Human Activity Recognition with ECDF Feature Network

This project implements a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system using ECDF-based feature prediction for representation learning. The system is designed to recognize 12 distinct human activities from IMU sensor data using a two-stage training pipeline:

**1. Encoder Training (Supervised Regression)**
   
A neural encoder is trained to predict ECDF (Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function) features derived from raw 9-channel IMU time-series data.
The model learns to regress a structured [3Ã—78] feature vector (78 features per axis) using MSE loss.

**2. Activity Classification**
   
After training, the encoder is frozen and used as a feature extractor. A lightweight classifier is then trained on top of the predicted ECDF features to perform multi-class classification across 12 activity classes.
